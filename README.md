End-users of this product will be embedding an image into their pages to track visits to their sites:
<img src="http://pixel-service/track" alt="SuperTracker Pixel" />

The solution captures requests to that image and stores visitors asynchronously in the plain text log for further analysis. The solution
consists of two services (projects): one collects the data, other handles writing to the file.
